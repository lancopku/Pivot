    """
    Computes the cross entropy loss of a sequence, weighted with respect to
    some user provided weights. Note that the weighting here is not the same as
    in the :func:`torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` criterion, which is weighting
    classes; here we are weighting the loss contribution from particular elements
    in the sequence. This allows loss computations for models which use padding.

    Parameters
    ----------
    logits : ``torch.FloatTensor``, required.
        A ``torch.FloatTensor`` of size (batch_size, sequence_length, num_classes)
        which contains the unnormalized probability for each class.
    targets : ``torch.LongTensor``, required.
        A ``torch.LongTensor`` of size (batch, sequence_length) which contains the
        index of the true class for each corresponding step.
    weights : ``torch.FloatTensor``, required.
        A ``torch.FloatTensor`` of size (batch, sequence_length)
    batch_average : bool, optional, (default = None).
        A bool indicating whether the loss should be averaged across the batch,
        or returned as a vector of losses per batch element.

        .. deprecated:: 0.6.2
           ``batch_average`` was deprecated and replaced with
           the more general ``average`` in version 0.6.2. It will be removed
           in version 0.8.

    average: str, optional (default = "batch")
        If "batch", average the loss across the batches. If "token", average
        the loss across each item in the input. If ``None``, return a vector
        of losses per batch element.
    label_smoothing : ``float``, optional (default = None)
        Whether or not to apply label smoothing to the cross-entropy loss.
        For example, with a label smoothing value of 0.2, a 4 class classifcation
        target would look like ``[0.05, 0.05, 0.85, 0.05]`` if the 3rd class was
        the correct label.

    Returns
    -------
    A torch.FloatTensor representing the cross entropy loss.
    If ``average=="batch"`` or ``average=="token"``, the returned loss is a scalar.
    If ``average is None``, the returned loss is a vector of shape (batch_size,).
